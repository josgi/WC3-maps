<h2>Description</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px"><span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Sentinels Campaign:</b></span><b> Terror of the Tides</b></span><br />
<i>Based on the work of <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/members/thespoon/" class="link link--internal">The-Spoon</a> and Blizzard Entertainment.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Interlude:</b></span><b> Unfinished Business</b></span><br />
<i>&quot;Late that evening, in the secluded Moonglade, Malfurion Stormrage and Tyrande Whisperwind discuss the aftermath of the Legion's invasion.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Chapter Five:</b></span><b> Balancing the Scales</b></span><br />
<i>&quot;The next day on the shores of the Broken Isles, Maiev and her Watchers attempt to hold the line against Illidan's final assault.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #60aa60"><b>General Changes:</b></span> <b>At the end of this map, you'll be granted two codes, one that holds the items of Maiev and Saithis and one that holds the items of Tyrande and Malfurion.</b> <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> The interlude, Unfinished Business, is integrated into this map. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Player One can control Malfurion and Player Two can control Tyrande. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> The rescue team and the ship drops are remade to not favor either payer. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> The secondary way to your base is now guarded by a custom hero. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Gold Coins you collect are evenly divided between the two players. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Features Warden Saithis as the second hero. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Features a number of systems: shared powerups, bounty, techtree, upgrades, infromation, tribute commands, tweaked upkeep levels and food limit, slow harvesting. (See Useful Links for more information.) <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> You can choose from two difficulties: Normal and Insane.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Insane Mode:</b></span> Your start with severely damaged structures. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> The AI of Illidan's Naga is improved. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Illidan is more powerful and has several items. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Serena Scarscale is more powerful and has several items. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Heroes receive less experience from kills. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Many creeps are replaced with more powerful creeps and some additional creeps are added to the rescue team's path. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> The Naga on the rescue team's path are more powerful.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Important Information:</b></span> The 2 Player Campaign is a concept first brought to Warcraft III by The-Spoon. The idea is to convert the original maps of Blizzard Entertainment so that it can be played by two people. <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/1715704-post1.html" class="link link--internal">The-Spoon, however, only wishes to complete the Reign of Chaos campaigns.</a> Therefore, I have decided to do the Sentinel campaign.<br />

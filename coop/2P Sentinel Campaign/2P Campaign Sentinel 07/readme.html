<h2>Description</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px"><span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Sentinels Campaign:</b></span><b> Terror of the Tides</b></span><br />
<i>Based on the work of <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/members/thespoon/" class="link link--internal">The-Spoon</a> and Blizzard Entertainment.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Interlude:</b></span><b> Malfurion's Vision</b></span><br />
<i>&quot;At that moment, deep within Silverpine Forest, Malfurion attempts to commune with the spirits of the wild.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Chapter Seven:</b></span><b> The Ruins of Dalaran</b></span><br />
<i>&quot;Later that evening, at the night elves' base camp, Malfurion returns to warn Maiev and Tyrande of his brother's dangerous sorcery.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #60aa60"><b>General Changes:</b></span> The interlude, Malfurion's Vision, is integrated into this map. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Player One controls Malfurion and Maiev, Player Two controls Saithis. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Tyrande's items are stored in a Stash. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> If Magroth is rescued, Player Two gains control of him. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Items stored in a Stash or carried by Magroth are also saved in your load code. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Kael also benefits from the Shared Powerups system. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span>  Features a number of systems: shared powerups, bounty, techtree, upgrades, infromation, tribute commands, tweaked upkeep levels and food limit, slow harvesting. (See Useful Links for more information.) <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> You can choose from two difficulties: Normal and Insane.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Insane Mode:</b></span> The AI of Illidan's Naga and the AI of Undead Scourge are improved. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Illidan and Serpentra are more powerful and have several items. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Heroes receive less experience from kills.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Important Information:</b></span> The 2 Player Campaign is a concept first brought to Warcraft III by The-Spoon. The idea is to convert the original maps of Blizzard Entertainment so that it can be played by two people. <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/1715704-post1.html" class="link link--internal">The-Spoon, however, only wishes to complete the Reign of Chaos campaigns.</a> Therefore, I have decided to do the Sentinel campaign.<br />

<h2>Description</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px"><span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Sentinels Campaign:</b></span><b> Terror of the Tides</b></span><br />
<i>Based on the work of <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/members/thespoon/" class="link link--internal">The-Spoon</a> and Blizzard Entertainment.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Chapter Six:</b></span><b> Shards of the Alliance</b></span><br />
<i>’Three days later, on the western coast of Lordaeron, the night elves venture cautiously into the shifting shadows of Silverpine Forest.’</i><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #60aa60"><b>General Changes:</b></span> Kael benefits from the shared powerups system. (See Useful Links for more information.) <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Player One can access Malfurion’s items and Player Two can access Saithis’ items through Stashes. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span>  Stashes are automatically teleported to any village the Caravan reaches. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span>  Items stored in a Stash are also saved in your load code. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span>  Gold Coins you collect are divided evenly between the two players. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span>  Features a number of systems: shared powerups, bounty, techtree, upgrades, infromation, tribute commands, tweaked upkeep levels and food limit, slow harvesting. (See Useful Links for more information.) <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> You can choose from two difficulties: Normal and Insane.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Insane Mode:</b></span> A Dreadlord leads the random attack waves. The Dreadlord becomes more powerful each time you slay him. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span>  Several enemy units are replaced by stronger units. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span>  Kael has Periapt of Health instead of Khadgar’s Gem of Health and Potion of Healing instead of Potion of Greater Healing. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Heroes receive much less experience from kills.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Important Information:</b></span> The 2 Player Campaign is a concept first brought to Warcraft III by The-Spoon. The idea is to convert the original maps of Blizzard Entertainment so that it can be played by two people. <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/1715704-post1.html" class="link link--internal">The-Spoon, however, only wishes to complete the Reign of Chaos campaigns.</a> Therefore, I have decided to do the Sentinel campaign.<br />

Due to many complications, the path of the caravan is now picked by typing -left or -right. The path of the caravan is also selected randomly after 30 seconds if no path is chosen. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Fixed a bug where the 'Retrieve Supplies' quest (and its multiboard) would not update if the second player picked the gold coin. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> The location of the supply caches for the 'Retrieve Supplies' quest are no longer revealed to the player.<br />

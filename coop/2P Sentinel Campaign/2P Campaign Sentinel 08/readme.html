<h2>Description</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px"><span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Sentinels Campaign:</b></span><b> Terror of the Tides</b></span><br />
<i>Based on the work of <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/members/thespoon/" class="link link--internal">The-Spoon</a> and Blizzard Entertainment.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Chapter Eight:</b></span><b> The Brothers Stormrage</b></span><br />
<i>'Hours later, along the banks of the River Arevass, Malfurion and Illidan work together to pick up Tyrande's trail. Moving quickly through the woods, their skills and senses start working in unison--their twin wills bent on finding their beloved priestess before it's too late.'</i><br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: #60aa60">Features artwork by</span> <span style="color: #ffcc00">Tarrasque</span> <span style="color: #60aa60">and</span> <span style="color: #ffcc00">JetFangInferno</span></b><br />
<br />
<span style="color: #60aa60"><b>General Changes:</b></span> The finale is integrated into this map. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Tyrande's portion of the map is greatly expanded and Tyrande now has a functional base. (This also means that Tyrande's death will no longer result in defeat, but losing her base will.) <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Player One controls Malfurion and Naj'entus, Player Two controls Tyrande and Illidan. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Features a custom Royal Guard Hero with a unique skillset to assist Illidan is rescuing Tyrande. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Illidan's portion of the map has additional items - These items were moved from the Blood Elf secret map, &quot;The Crossing&quot;, which won't be a playable map of the two player campaign. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> Tyrande and Malfurion are more independant than Naj'entus and Illidan: Tyrande and Malfurion share their techtree and upgrades, but don't slow harvest, can have up to 100 units and use Blizzard's upkeep levels. Illidan and Naj'entus use the two player upkeep levels, can have up to 60 units and slow harvest. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span>  Features a number of systems: shared powerups, bounty, techtree, upgrades, infromation, tribute commands, tweaked upkeep levels and food limit, slow harvesting. (See Useful Links for more information.) <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> You can choose from two difficulties: Normal and Insane.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Insane Mode:</b></span> All enemy heroes are level 10, have additional skills and items. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> The AI of all undead bases is improved. <span style="color: #60aa60">/</span> All undead bases start with all available upgrades instead of researching them.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: #60aa60"><b>Important Information:</b></span> The 2 Player Campaign is a concept first brought to Warcraft III by The-Spoon. The idea is to convert the original maps of Blizzard Entertainment so that it can be played by two people. <a href="http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/1715704-post1.html" class="link link--internal">The-Spoon, however, only wishes to complete the Reign of Chaos campaigns.</a> Therefore, I have decided to do the Sentinel campaign.<br />
